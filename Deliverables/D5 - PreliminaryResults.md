# D5 - Preliminary Results

## Research Questions
This part of the presentation will help us remember your research and check
whether your results really answer the research questions. You can refine your research questions based
on the results (you can even add/remove RQs if needed). Remember that research is an iterative process.
- RQ 1: How many pull requests have been created on a particular Github project?
- RQ 2: Referring to specific users, how many pull requests of theirs have been accepted?

## Method
Explain how you collected and analyzed your data, detailing each step. This part will help us
understand what you did and check for possible biases in the data collection/analysis.

## Results
Present the results, organized per research question. You can present numbers, graphs, tables,
etc.
